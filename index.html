    <p>My name is Vishal Patel, a student at UCI's Data Analytics Bootcamp. I am from Riverside California, and I graduated from UCI with a degree in General Computer Science.
      I took this Bootcamp to further my career in Data, as that is the path I would like to follow.

    <p>My favorite sport is basketball, although I like most sports. Basketball is the most fun to me becuase of the heroic nature. 10 players one one small court and it produces great
      storylines.
